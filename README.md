Fractal-Generation
==================

Fractal Generation programs. Feel free to add your code to this repo. But please adhere to the rules:

1. Add comments a'plenty. Best to teach the new ones than to write speedy code. 
2. Be playful, show us how "you" code. 
3. No voodoo code / ghost code. Follow the KISS method: Keep It Simple Stupid.
